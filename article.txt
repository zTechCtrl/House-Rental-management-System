Project: House Rental Management System using PHP/MySQLi

About
The House Rental Management System is a simple PHP/MySQLi project that helps manages the records and payments of certain house rental businesses. This system stores the list of house categories/types, houses, tenants, and monthly payments. The house type and house information will be used in identifying the tenant's rented house and monthly payable rate. This project is manageable only by the business management which is the system admin or staff. Using the house rental management system, the management can easily retrieve the payment records of a certain tenant and contains important information such as the outstanding balance of the tenant. The outstanding balance will serve as the expected next payment amount of the tenant and this field may also display a negative result which means that the tenant has an advance amount paid which will be automatically credited for the next month payment but if the advance payment still greater than the monthly rental amount, the amount will only deduct the monthly rental rate tenant will still have an advance payment for the next month. The system generates also a printable report for the monthly payment report and tenant's rental balances report.
